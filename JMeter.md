To load JMeter output into Logstash and aggregated in Elasticsearch so that Kibana can display analytics graphs:

What Iâ€™m hoping for is a few graph in Kibana that illustrates test run conclusions:

1. <a href="#NetworkVariation">Network variation</a> based on response time reaching landing page only.
2. <a href="#LandingPageCapacity">Landing page capacity</a> transactions-per-second maximum.
3. <a href="#SignUpCapacity">Sign-Up capacity</a> showing how many new users can register in a short period of time.
4. <a href="#WorkCapacity">Ramp-up capacity</a> showing how many registered users can do work at once based on 
   stress test runs (showing transactions per minute vs. response time).
5. <a href="#CapacityUsage">Capacity usage</a> based on memory per user over time.
6. <a href="#Longevity">Longevity</a> showing memory leaks identified during longer runs.
