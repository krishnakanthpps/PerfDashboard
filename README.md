How to store stuff and make sense of 
The "ELK" stack (for Elasticsearch Logstash Kibana) really should be LEK because 

1. <strong>Logstach</strong> collects timestamped data from various sources, filters out junk, normalize into JSON

2. <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> indexes (inverted) nested aggregations of data in Hadoop

3. <strong>Kibana</strong> identifies actionable insights after data discovery

But LEK doesn't spell and pronounce like a one-syllable name for a big animal with a big rack.
(actually that was taken for something else).

There is a lighter edition of Logstash.

Kibana & Elasticsearch started as an open source project, built by devops people for devops people.

It's priced by node to be managed and monitor at scale (less than Splunk and doesn't run out of gas).
There's no separate enterprise edition.

Marvel is free until production.

Version 4 was a major upgrade than version 3.

* D3 JS library flexibility
* Watcher - 
* Shield support for security


* Pie charts have nested levels

Kibana installs with its own Node.js server. It doesn't use a web server.

A single node is a master, data, and client nodes.
A node specializes into data and client nodes.
